# Introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Course

## Overview

Welcome to the "Introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)" course! This course will help you to effectively analyze and gain insights from various datasets.

## Course Content

This course consists of the following modules:

1. **Understanding your data:** Before starting analysis, we first understand the data.

2. **Dealing with Missing Values:** Learn how to identify and handle missing data in a dataset using appropriate techniques.

3. **Dealing with Duplicate Data:** Explore methods to detect and manage duplicate records in your data.

4. **Dealing with Outliers:** Discover how to identify and handle outliers that can impact your analysis.

5. **Correction of DataType:** According to the data and analysis, we will see how to change the datatype.

6. **Univariate Analysis:** Learn how to perform univariate analysis to examine the distribution and characteristics of individual variables.

11. **Univariate Analysis Visualization:** Discover visualization techniques for univariate analysis to gain deeper insights into data patterns.

12. **Bivariate Analysis:** Understand how to perform bivariate analysis to explore relationships between two variables.
